# PasswordGenerator

In this assignemnt I created a password generator: 
It prompts the user to chose how long they want their password -- between 8 and 128 characters
It then asks the user if it wants:
Upper case characters
Special characters
Lower case characters
Numbers

The user must chose one option. 

Once the user has chosen which characters it wants it will generate the password and put it in the box.
